# Overview
The GPA Calculator is a Java-based application designed to calculate a student's Grade Point Average (GPA) based on their grades and corresponding course credits. The application uses a command-line interface for input and provides users with their calculated GPA instantly.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills in Java, including data structure utilization (HashMap) and user input validation. Future iterations will expand the project into a full-stack web application.
